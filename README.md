# grayscale-image-template-match
A MATLAB algorithm for grayscale image template matching. I taught myself of machine vision at that time and get the image-pyramid idea from Stack Overflow. And this was put into my master peper that I will attach(with limited academic ability, experts can overlook this code -_-).
You can use MATLAB/Octave to run this algorithm. If with MATLAB, "image processing toolbox" is needed. With Octave, the run time will be longer. Image template match is time-consuming, especilly, when with template rotating. So here I use the image pyramid method: scale down image and template(a smaller image) at the same time; then do the matching in small size image(top layer in the image pyramid) to get the rough pisitive of the target; then go back to next low pyramid image, to match in a relative small area around the piont find in the previous matching. Loop this manipulation down to the origin image.
For targets rotating angle matching, I make a series of template of different rotating angle which generate by rotate the origin template a small setp angle each time.
But my algorithm is very slow, it takes 3.2 second to finish a task: image size 1024x768, template size 250x511, multi-targets, rotating angle detecting. -_- After that, I have no time to improve it. But I always think whether I can put the code on the Internet if someone may find it's usful until I find getHub.
